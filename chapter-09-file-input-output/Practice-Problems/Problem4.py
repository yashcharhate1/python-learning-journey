# Q4. A file contains the word "Donkey" multiple times. You need to write a program which replace this word with ##### by updating the same file.

word = "Donkey"

with open("donkey.txt", "r") as f:
    content = f.read()

contentNew = content.replace(word, "######")

# print(contentNew)

with open("donkey.txt", "w") as f:
    f.write(contentNew)
